		    <p>Bryan does not do easy, or obvious, or expected. He prefers the long-shot work, underdog work, work that is uncomfortable -- work that topples the well-established and disrupts the status quo. </p>

        <p>Bryan holds a bachelors degree in political science from the University of Chicago, a masters degree in film from the University of Southern California and a black belt in judo â€“ where quite literally the bigger they are, the harder they fall.</p>
        <p>Bryan does not change opinion; he changes how people think.</p>
