		    <p>Bryan does the hard work, the long-shot work, the underdog work that topples the well-established and disrupts the status quo.&nbsp;
          He led public finance authorities to be upgraded when Illinois peers were downgraded to junk; he ran successful bootstrapped political
          campaigns against the machine, and he just recently helped his wife open Chicago’s first medical cannabis dispensary – big Pharma beware.
          He holds a bachelors degree in political science from the University of Chicago, a masters degree in film from the University of Southern
          California and a black belt in judo – where quite literally the bigger they are, the harder they fall.</p>
        <p>Bryan does not change opinion; he changes how people think.</p>
