In 2007, a vehemently anti-incumbent environment threatened many long-time incumbent Chicago aldermen. Several were stunningly defeated, and Ald. Danny Solis was in the race of his career.  Facing two former aldermen (including one with a nearly identical name) a well-funded woman candidate, a strong grassroots ethnic challenger and several others, Solis looked to become another casualty of the times.

With a strategy that went to the heart of anti-incumbency challenges, Zises Communications helped Solis prevail with well over 50%. We avoided a run-off election entirely and shocked the political pundits with this success.
