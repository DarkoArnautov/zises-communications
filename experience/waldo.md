Street festivals are an iconic part of Chicago's DNA, and how the city celebrates the importance aspects of its culture. The [Annual Waldos Forever Festival](http://waldosforever.com) is no exception. Held on 4-20 of course, the street fair in the Andersonville neighborhood is the city's first - and the midwest's largest - pro-cannabis annual event. 

Dozens of vendors and dignitaries celebrate with thousands of pro-cannabis patrons each year to enjoy the legalization, celebrate the medicine, learn and mingle.
