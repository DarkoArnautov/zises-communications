Politics has been called Chicago's favorite full-contact sport. We love a good tussle. 

Started in 2010, the pro-Latino [Chicago Latino Political Action Committee](https://www.facebook.com/CLPACILLINOIS/) supports candidates and elected officials who fight to achieve equality and opportunity in education, community development and business opportunity.
